# Hype OPL3 patch

This IPS patch, made by Brazilian MSX users Maur√≠cio Braga (Mauk) and Pablo Vasques (Parn), replaces the Hype soundtrack with a new OPL3 arrangement. It must be applied on the original cassette release by ByteBusters (in CAS format) and generates a ROM image. It can be used with any Moonsound compatible sound card and also with second-generation FPGA MSX models, such as the S-MX.
